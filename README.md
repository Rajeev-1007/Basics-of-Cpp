Aim: Write a C++ program to print "Hello World" and perform various calculator programs.


Software Used: VS Code.


Theory:  "Hello, World!" introduces a language’s basic syntax, structure, and output functionality. It helps learners understand compilation or interpretation processes without logic complexity.


Syntax:

    cout<<"Hello World";


Calculator programs, like addition or subtraction, deepen familiarity with variables, data types, and I/O operations. These small exercises build a foundation for control flow, modular design, and arithmetic processing. They're a bridge to functions, debugging, and building scalable applications—from command-line tools to embedded systems.
Mastering these basics nurtures precision and logic, crucial in fields like electronics, software engineering, and automation. They prepare learners for structured problem-solving and advanced tasks like sensor data handling or recursive algorithms.

Syntax:

    cout << "Addition: " << a + b;
    cout << "Subtraction: " << a - b;
    cout << "Multiplication: " << a * b;
    cout << "Division: " << a / b;


Conclusion: "Hello, World!" and calculator programs build core programming skills—from syntax and output to arithmetic operations. These simple constructs lay the groundwork for mastering input, logic, and structure, forming a strong base for more complex coding applications.
